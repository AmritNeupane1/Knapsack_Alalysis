# Knapsack_Analysis
The NP problem includes the 0/1 knapsack problem, which is a common problem in the fields of
operations research and combinatorial optimization. The study of the 0/1 knapsack problem
algorithm's answers has a lot of practical significance. The 0/1 knapsack problem algorithms
were described in this paper with algorithm analysis and design and all of them have different
benefits and drawbacks associated with them. We plan to investigate five distinct algorithms for
solving the 0/1 Knapsack issue, as well as the sorts of datasets on which these algorithms will
succeed and when they will fail.
five Algorithms are : 1.Greedy Algorithm
                      2.Dynamic Programming
                      3.Fully Polynomial Approximation Scheme
                      4.Branch and Bound
                      5,Genetic Algorithms
